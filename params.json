{"name":"Hector","body":"### Introduction\r\nHector is a location transparent web-framework written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) which makes heavy use of [Akka](http://www.akka.io/).\r\n\r\n### Routing\r\nRequests are routed with a partial function. It could not be simpler than that.\r\n\r\n```\r\nval userProfileActor = context.actorOf(Props[UserProfileActor])\r\n\r\ndef routes = {\r\n  case Get(\"user\" /: publicKey /: _) ⇒  Route(userProfileActor, Some(publicKey → true))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHector is always specific. A requests ends with a `Required_/` or `No_/` but in this case we do not care so we use `_`.\r\n\r\n### HTML\r\nHector comes with an excellent HTML emitter that is more secure and faster than Scala's built-in XML [Utility](http://www.scala-lang.org/api/current/scala/xml/Utility$.html).\r\n\r\nIt can generate beautiful and human readable HTML code with proper indentation or omit all unnecessary whitespace. But it will never break your content like `Utility.trim` does.\r\n\r\n### JavaScript\r\nIf HTML is salt, JavaScript is pepper and both together create a spicy combination. Hector mixes pepper with steroids so that you get awesome JavaScript support.\r\n\r\nHector comes with typed top-level definitions which evaluate to an [AST](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). `window.alert(window.status.length * 2)` is actual Scala code which is compiled and minified on the server.\r\n\r\nYou can either write JavaScript using the typed top-level and implicit conversions or write it completely manual. Here are two examples that both result in `(function(){hector.execCallback('...')})()` on the client.\r\n\r\n```\r\n// Generate the AST manually:\r\n\r\nJsCall(\r\n  callee = JsFunc(\r\n    id = None,\r\n    parameters = Seq.empty,\r\n    body = JsBlock(\r\n      JsCall(\r\n        JsMember(JsIdentifier('hector), JsIdentifier('execCallback)),\r\n        Seq(callbackName)\r\n      )\r\n    )\r\n  ),\r\n  arguments = Seq.empty\r\n)\r\n\r\n// Using implicits and the DSL (will result in same AST):\r\n\r\n(function { ('hector ~> 'execCallback)(callbackName) })()\r\n```\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Location Transparent Web Framework","google":"UA-30550105-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
